# Gnome-Veteran

a GTK2,and GTK3 file for the Gnome-desktop

![s](https://cn.pling.com/img/9/2/d/7/cb9b77339bda356c1bcbef40ea74d9e74ee5.jpg)

This is a mash-up of several of my themes. Its major new main-feature is the dual-sidebar-behaviour in the file-manager (nautilus).

This theme is solid, tested and up-to-date for Gnome 3.26+, to use as daily desktop-theme.

For Ubuntu 17.10+: Make sure that gtk2-engines-pixbuf is installed.

If not, open terminal and paste and execute this: sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf

### How to install:

First: Just copy the extracted file to a '.themes'-folder you make in your home directory. For systemwide use copy the files to usr/share/themes.

Then use Tweak-tool to select the GTK theme.

LOG OUT AND BACK IN for changes to take effect !
